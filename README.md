### Hello There!

Welcome to my ByteStore!
This project is a Fullstack E-Commerce website that demonstrates use of:
# Ruby on Rails 7, Hotwire, Tailwind, Stripe, PostgreSQL and Gems like Devise and AASM.

## Setup steps:
While setting up the application, run the following commands:
1. `bundle install`
2. `rails db:create`
3. `rails db:seed`
4. `bin/dev`      (This calls the Procfile.dev which loads the server and the css classes)
